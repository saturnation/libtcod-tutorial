# Introduction #

libtcod is a free, fast, portable and uncomplicated API for roguelike
developers providing an advanced true color console, input, and lots of other
utilities frequently used in roguelikes.

# What can it do? #

If you want to get a quick overview of the features that libtcod provides, check out the [Features](https://bitbucket.org/libtcod/libtcod/wiki/Features) page.

If you want to get a quick overview of games which have used libtcod, check out the [Projects](http://roguecentral.org/doryen/projects-2/) page.

libtcod is also well known for it's [easy to follow tutorial](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod), which many people have used to get started developing a roguelike.  Follow the relevant links the tutorial gives, and it will point you to the right locations.

# How do I get set up? #

## Using one of our downloads ##

Windows and MacOS binaries are available from the
[GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod/releases).

If you are programming in C or C++, various sample projects are included within
the repository which can be used as examples of various features.

For those who wish to program in Python the basics are described in
[part 1](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod,_part_1#Setting_it_up)
of the tutorial.
It's currently recommended to install libtcodpy via
[python-tcod](https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod) rather than using the
libtcodpy package included in this repository.

**Warning:** If you download these builds, run `samples.exe` as your very first
action.
If you are unable to and get an error about `vcruntime140.dll` being missing,
you need to install the two
[Visual Studio 2015 runtimes](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53587).
Make sure you install the 32-bit runtime.
And make sure you also install the 64-bit runtime.
Then run `samples.exe` again, and it should now work.
Whether you plan to develop in C, C++, Python or some other language, this is
required.

## Compiling from source ##

You can clone with Mercurial via the
[BitBucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/libtcod/libtcod), or with Git via
the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod).
You can then checkout a specific tag or get the in-development version from
the default or master branches.

All compilation methods, currently including Visual Studio (Windows),
SCons (Windows, Linux, MacOS) and Autotools (Linux, MacOS), are located within
the `build/` subdirectory.

Windows users who prefer to use Visual Studio directly can either run the
top-level 'build.bat' script, or locate and open the provided solution directly
using Visual Studio.
The solution is currently for Visual Studio 2015, and the
[free community edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) is highly
recommended.

SCons automatically downloads SDL2 and can be used on all platforms.
Instructions are
[provided here](https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod/tree/master/build/scons).
The current release builds are built using SCons.

Autotools is a common standard on Linux, and can be used for MacOS.
Instructions are
[provided here](https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod/tree/master/build/autotools).

If you ever need to statically compile libtcod the easiest method would be to
use the `src/libtcod_c.c` and `src/libtcod.cpp` source files, which include all
the other sources.  Further instructions are included in those files.

# Getting Started #

The latest documentation is [here](https://libtcod.readthedocs.io/en/latest).
Currently it's very incomplete, so most people will want to read the
[1.5.1 documentation](http://roguecentral.org/doryen/data/libtcod/doc/1.5.1/index2.html?c=true&cpp=true&cs=false&py=true&lua=false)
instead.

libtcod comes with a sample application, implementations of which are provided
in each of
C ([samples_c.c](https://bitbucket.org/libtcod/libtcod/src/tip/samples/samples_c.c?at=default)),
C++ ([samples_cpp.cpp](https://bitbucket.org/libtcod/libtcod/src/tip/samples/samples_cpp.cpp?at=default)),
and Python ([samples_py.py](https://bitbucket.org/libtcod/libtcod/src/tip/python/samples_py.py?at=default)).
This provides a decent overview of the basic features, in an interactive
fashion.
Each should be identical for the most part, so if you are using Windows,
downloading the pre-compiled binaries and running the included `samples.exe`
which is compiled from the C source code, should be representative of the other
versions.
