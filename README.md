# libtcod-tutorial
A C implementation of the code from the Python libtcod tutorial from http://www.rogueliketutorials.com/

This implemenation is Windows based, but only in that it includes the Window's libtcod. Hopefully you can just delete that and drop in your OS'es libtcod and it should still work with cmake?
